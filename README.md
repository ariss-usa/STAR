# STAR
The ARISS STAR Project code and docs are contained within this repo.
The STAR project allows for an easy way for a user to control the Makeblock mBot remotely and locally through a simple user interface.

## Purpose ##
The purpose of this project is to prepare and familiarize students with remote communications before their contact with the International Space Station. 
[Learn more about ARISS!](https://www.ariss.org/)

## Usage ##
To control your mBot using this app, you simply need to plug the Bluetooth dongle into the device running the application, and turn on the mBot.
The mBot's flashing blue light should turn to a solid blue light to indicate successful pairing. Click the pair dropdown -> Select the Bluetooth dongle's COM port -> click pair. To send commands, select a robot (select the COM port for local control) and enter time, direction, and power values, then hit the send button.
